## Unit 6 | Assignment - What's the Weather Like?

## Description

For this assignment I used Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## WeatherPy

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of ~500 cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

I utilized the [citipy Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) to randomly select 500 cities for my sample analysis 

I used these city names to gather weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Utimately i built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
